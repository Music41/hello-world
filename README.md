creating my first repository

This is Bruce Jackson Sr. and I am desiring to learn software development. I am attending American International University (AIU) online as I am working for Tennessee Valley Authority as a laborer. I am working towards a bachelor's degree in Specialization in Software Analysis and Development at this university but is getting stump on my two recent classes: object Oriented Application Development I, which I am attempting to code in java; and Applications of Discrete Mathematics and Statistics in IT. Both is very challenging for a beginner like me that have not code before and each class last five weeks each which makes it more interesting. I hope that Free Code Camp will be what I am looking for to get a better understanding of coding as a whole as well as helping me finish up the next 12 to 14 months at AIU to finally have that degree also under my belt. Your help will be very appreciated.
